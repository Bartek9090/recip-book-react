# Recipe App

-------------------------
## Description
Recipe app built with React. This project utilizes functional components, React hooks, React router
and integrates with an external recipe API using axios. The purpose of building this project was 
to practice React concepts, component structure, and API integration.
This is a project entirely of my own invention.

Project has been deployed on netlify.
